# Keep a working copy of this repository on $SCRATCH and bring the keepers back.
#
# WHY. Runs are I/O heavy and highly concurrent, and $PERM is a single NFS filer:
# measured with 30 simultaneous writers, $PERM sustains 530 MB/s against 4863
# MB/s on $SCRATCH, which is Lustre -- a factor of 9.2. So the model, the
# post-processing and the benchmark all belong on $SCRATCH. But $SCRATCH is
# pruned automatically and is not safe for anything you want to keep, so the two
# trees are duals: bulk and scratch work there, results live here.
#
# The reads are the half that is easy to miss. Workers inside one array element
# share that node's single NFS client, so 48 of them reading forcing over NFS
# starve even when the output is already on Lustre -- measured in the sibling
# PLUMBER2 repo at 7% CPU per worker, with no site finishing in 40 minutes. Job
# 36354918 here lost 480 CPU-hours to exactly that shape: output on $SCRATCH,
# inputs and executable still on $PERM.
#
#   push : $PERM -> $SCRATCH   inputs and code (forcing, clim, flux, namelists,
#                              scripts) -- everything a run needs, nothing it
#                              produces
#   pull : $SCRATCH -> $PERM   results only (postprocessed/, benchmark/models/,
#                              benchmark/dashboards/) -- never raw output/, which
#                              is ~750 GB per campaign and regenerable
#   status: what exists on each side
#
# The mirror keeps the same layout as this repository, so every script works
# there unchanged and with no flags: the run scripts derive their project root
# from their own location, and postproc.py / benchmark.py use paths relative to
# the tree they are run from. The intended cycle is
#
#   scripts/scratch_mirror.sh push -g shuttle-all775-era5
#   cd $SCRATCH/ifs-landbench
#   scripts/submit_ecland_slurm.sh -g shuttle-all775-era5 -i \
#     -x $SCRATCH/ifs-landbench/ecland-build/bin/ecland-master-dp
#   python3 scripts/postproc.py --inputdir output --outdir postprocessed
#   python3 scripts/benchmark.py
#   cd -; scripts/scratch_mirror.sh pull
#
# WHY -g. Unlike the sibling repo, forcing/, clim/ and flux/ here are split by
# site group, and the groups are large. Pushing one group copies about 14 GB
# against 26 for all three, and a run only ever reads its own group. Without -g
# the whole of each directory travels.
#
# -r trims that further to the ~2 GB the model itself needs, by leaving out the
# flux/ observations that only benchmark.py reads. It is a way to get a run
# started sooner, not the normal path: the mirror is meant to be self-contained,
# as it is in the sibling repo, so a plain push carries flux/ too and the whole
# run/postproc/benchmark cycle works there without touching $PERM again.
#
# WHAT IS NOT COPIED BACK. Raw model output (output/), run state (status/,
# claims/, logs/, slurm/, work/) and the git metadata. Raw output is the biggest
# thing on the scratch side and the cheapest to reproduce; if you need a site's
# restart for an NLOOP=1 rerun, copy that file deliberately rather than the tree.

Usage: $(basename "$0") {push|pull|status} [-g GROUP] [-n] [-M MIRROR]

  push        Copy inputs and code to the mirror (${PUSH_PATHS[*]} ${GROUP_PATHS[*]})
  pull        Copy results back from the mirror (${PULL_PATHS[*]})
  status      Show both sides without copying anything

  -g GROUP    Restrict ${GROUP_PATHS[*]} to this site group (default: all groups)
  -r          Run inputs only: skip ${RUN_ONLY_SKIP[*]}, which only the benchmark reads
  -n          Dry run: print what rsync would transfer
  -M MIRROR   Mirror location (default: ${MIRROR})

Deletions are never propagated: rsync runs without --delete in both directions,
so a stale file in the mirror is possible but losing a result is not.
