     "estimate the missing values from the tower's own data, or take them from ERA5, the weather "
     "record that comes packaged with each site. Which one you pick matters far more than any quality "
     "setting. On the same 775 sites with the same settings, filling from the tower's own data gave "
     "usable weather for 231 sites; filling from ERA5 gave all 775. The tower's own data cannot fill a "
     "long gap, and a year with a gap left in it is thrown away completely. So ERA5 is used throughout. "
     "The price is that a good deal of the data is then weather-model output rather than measurement, "
     "which section 5 sets out in full.")
para("A note on names: the conversion software calls this option “ERAinterim”, after an older weather "
     "record, but the data the Shuttle actually supplies is ERA5. The columns and timestamps line up "
     "exactly with what the software expects, so it works as-is.", size=9.5)

h("3.2 CO2 was quietly costing us 97 sites", 2)
para("A year is thrown away if any weather variable still has a hole in it once the filling is done. "
     "CO2 is the one variable ERA5 cannot help with, because weather records do not carry the amount of "
     "CO2 in the air. So 97 sites were being thrown away entirely over CO2 — a variable this setup does "
     "not even use, since CO2 feedback on plant growth is switched off and CO2 only comes out of the "
     "model, never into it. Missing CO2 is now filled from NOAA's monthly global average, which has run "
     "since 1979. Filled values are marked as the lowest quality class, so they are still counted and "
     "reported as filled rather than passed off as measurements. This brought back all 97 sites and "
     "264 site-years, without loosening a single quality threshold.")

para("The conversion software ships with a list of sites to skip, and CZ-BK2 is on it with no reason "
